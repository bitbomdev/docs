A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a formal, machine-readable inventory of software components and dependencies used in building an application. Think of it as a "list of ingredients" that provides transparency into what makes up a piece of software.

## Key Components

An SBOM typically includes:

- **Component Names**: The names of all software components, libraries, and modules
- **Version Information**: Specific versions of each component being used
- **Supplier Data**: Who created/maintains each component
- **Dependency Relationships**: How different components relate to and depend on each other
- **License Information**: The licenses governing each component
- **Timestamps**: When the SBOM was generated

## Why SBOMs Matter

SBOMs have become increasingly important for several reasons:

1. **Security**: They help organizations quickly identify if they're affected by newly discovered vulnerabilities in any components
2. **Compliance**: They assist in tracking license obligations and regulatory requirements
3. **Supply Chain Management**: They provide visibility into software dependencies and potential supply chain risks
4. **Risk Assessment**: They enable better evaluation of potential security and legal risks in software

## Regulatory Context

In 2021, the U.S. Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity (14028) made SBOMs a requirement for software vendors working with the federal government, highlighting their growing importance in software security and supply chain risk management.
