[Roaring bitmaps](https://roaringbitmap.org/) are a highly efficient data structure for storing and processing sets of 32-bit integers, offering exceptional compression while maintaining fast operation speeds. They have become the go-to solution for many high-performance systems including Youtube, Microsoft, Netflix, and many others.

## Key Benefits

- Can be hundreds of times faster than traditional compressed bitmaps
- Significantly better compression ratios
- Maintains fast operations despite compression
- Used by major tech companies and databases worldwide

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed
- Fast set operations (AND, OR, XOR) through optimized algorithms
- Quick element lookup through binary search or direct bitmap access
- Container-level operations can skip empty ranges
- Maintains high performance even with large datasets

### Space Efficiency
- Real-world example: Reduced memory usage from 125GB to 300MB in one case
- Adapts storage strategy based on data density
- No significant speed penalty for compression
- Dynamic container conversion based on cardinality

## Limitations

Roaring bitmaps, are extremely efficient, and "Roaring bitmaps are designed to store sets of 32-bit (unsigned) integers. Thus a Roaring bitmap can contain up to **4294967296** integers." ([Roaring Bitmap Spec](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringFormatSpec?tab=readme-ov-file#standard-32-bit-roaring-bitmap))

That means that they are able to store **more than 4 billion integers in a single bitmap**.

1. **32-bit Integer Restriction**
   - Designed specifically for 32-bit unsigned integers
   - Requires mapping other data types to this range

2. **Memory Overhead**
   - Small overhead from container management
   - May not be optimal for very small sets

3. **Uniform Distribution**
   - Less effective compression for uniformly distributed data
   - Traditional bitsets might be better for small, dense sets

## Best Use Cases

Roaring bitmaps excel in:
- Search engines and databases
- Large-scale data analytics
- Systems requiring fast set operations
- Scenarios with sparse or clustered data
- Applications needing both space efficiency and speed

Roaring bitmaps represent a significant advancement in bitmap technology, offering an rare combination of both space efficiency and speed, making them an excellent choice for modern high-performance systems dealing with large sets of integers.
